		<h1>MEDITATION IN NATURE</h1>
		<h2>Benefits of Meditation</h2>

		<p>Life can be stressful, but meditation is scientifically proven to lower your stress levels. It’s possible to increase your capacity for joy, gratitude, and love, no magical thinking required. The aim of meditation practices is to help us be more present with our experiences in the body and the mind, with as little reactivity as possible.</p>

		<p>Meditation in nature can improve our mood, lower our blood pressure, reduce stress and anxiety, sharpen mental focus, and can boost our creativity. Meditating outdoors activates our senses, making our practice more alert and wakeful.</p>

		<p>Most mindfulness meditations can be practiced outdoors. In addition to awareness-of-breath practice, walking meditation and focusing on sounds are great fits when you’re meditating outside. With walking meditation, you will pay attention to the contact of your feet with the ground as you mindfully advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/BHACKCNDMW8" target="_blank"> Music for Walking Meditation </a> </p>

		<p>So, the next time you’re feeling stressed out, overwhelmed, or just a bit blah…step outside for some all-natural, feel-good vibes. Take a few minutes for yourself.  Feel the warmth of the sun on your face, listen to the birds, watch the squirrels jumping from tree to tree, and notice the wind blowing.</p>
